# Git Workflow Assignment

## What I found interesting
This article helped me because it explains how pull requests are more than just "a way to merge code." A PR is an organized way to work together and collaborate at a checkpoint: you suggest changes, other people can look them over, ask questions, and ask for fixes, and then the changes are merged. That flow makes working together less disorganized and less likely to break something or step on someone else's work by accident.

Also, I like that PRs leave a clear paper trail. It's clear what was changed, who made the change, and why it was accepted. Accountability is important for a class for real engineering teams because it makes inputs easier to check, boosts communication, and turns version control into a real workflow instead of just a backup system.

## Reflection (From Fork)
Wow, an article about PR to practice PR!

I think PR's are a great ways to hear contributions and decide which ones are worth keeping and which ones are not (for their own purposes).

Great article choice! PRs are essential for team collaboration. I like how they make code reviews systematic and transparent.
